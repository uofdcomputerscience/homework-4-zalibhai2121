# Homework 4

The purpose of this homework is simply to remind yourselves about basic navigation. Therefore, within the storyboard for this application:

* Create two additional view controllers, adding a label or similar item to be able to determine what they are. No unique class creation is needed.
* Embed the existing ViewController into a navigation controller
* Add two buttons to the existing view controller
* One button should use a *modal* presentation to display another view controller
* The other button should use a *navigation push* presentation to display another view controller.
